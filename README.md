## Biography

Ercole Sarti was born on the 23rd December 1593 in Ficarolo, a small town in the Polesine area on the left bank of the Po river near Rovigo. He was born to Giovanni Sarti and Fulvia Nigrisoli and was one of the most accomplished artists in the Estense region in the first half of the seventeenth century. He was the grandson of Bartolomeo Sarti, a lawyer and owner of properties in Ficarolo and Ferrara. The family was affluent and had a great collection of art comprising 92 paintings, a selection of maps and a library of 430 volumes.
 
A particularly defining event occurred during his adolescence short of turning sixteen years of age on the occasion of a festival in which a solemn procession took place. Seemingly unbeknown to anyone else, Sarti had painted a picture representing the biblical scene of the Adoration of the Magi, and had placed it on his father’s doorstep. This story was first recorded by a historian and scholar from Ferrara, Marc’Antonio Guarini, in one of his libretti Relazione published in 1611. The libretto contains poems celebrating the event, three of which by Guarino Guarini, who was also the author of four verses inscribed at the base of Sarti's painting. An anecdote from 1816 narrates that this is one of Sarti’s first mentioned works, and may well be his first ever, and the unexpected nature of its production brought about much admiration and astonishment, being regarded as little short of a miracle. The event attracted the attention of cardinals and princes, prompting the then bishop of Ferrara, Giovanni Fontana, to inform Pope Paul V. On 3 October 1610, more than 5000 people paraded through the streets of Ficarolo, bringing the picture to its new location into a newly built chapel in the Church of Sant’Antonio Martire, which was erected thanks to the munificence of Bartolomeo Sarti, Ercole’s grandfather. It is possible that Bartolomeo’s generosity in sponsoring the chapel inspired Ercole to pay homage to the image.
 
Shortly after this miraculous event occurred, at the mere age of 17, Sarti painted a Crucifixion with donor and Saints Valentine and Carlo Borromeo adorning the apse of the parish church of San Valentino in Ficarolo, which remains one of his most well-known works. His rising popularity and the recognition of his talent prompted the young artist to relocate to Ferrara, where his family owned a house in the central parish of San Francesco. In Ferrara, he entered the workshop of Ippolito Scarsella, also known as Scarsellino (c. 1550–1620) who had trained in Bologna and Venice and worked in the bottega of Paolo Veronese. When Scarsellino returned to Ferrara he inherited his father’s workshop and set up a studio in the Estense Castle, where Ercole Sarti was one of the pupils trained. One of the pedagogical methods employed by Scarsellino, a well-established practice in Ferrarese workshops, was copying and drawing. An inventory of Scarsellino’s possessions includes over 100 drawings, most of which were used for teaching, and almost 300 models in wax representing animals, heads and figures. Lanzi suggests that Sarti was instructed through gestures.
 
After the death of Scarsellino in 1620, Sarti started his own practice, completing public and private commissions in Ferrara and the nearby pronvinces of Mantua and Rovigo. He worked in areas around Lombardy, upper Emilia and lower Veneto on subjects and projects mainly of a religious theme. Many of these works appear in the village of Quatrelle in Felonica in the Lombardy region, and Salara in Rovigo in the parish church of San Valentino and Ficarolo, his hometown.
 
Sarti’s talent is recounted by historians, where his skill is constantly emphasised; he was regarded as a “prodigy of genius and expectation”. In the Efemeridi letterarie di Roma published in 1772, Sarti’s artistic characteristics are described as very beautiful even if a little too accented in the contours. A similar interpretation appears in Descrizione della quadreria from 1841, where Camillo Laderchi describes his style as resembling that of Scarsellino, only that Sarti’s forms become less gentle with slightly more decisive contours. He is also noted for being a highly regarded portrait painter and was employed by the nobility in Ferrara as well as for the churches. 

The most monumental and foundational sources of evidence that exist on Sarti come from two poems dedicated to the artist, where both poets render him as the living emblem of painting as muta poesis where his circumstances were celebrated by poets as miraculous. As well as the celebrated poet Giambattista Marino (1569–1625) dedicating a composition in La Galeria to Sarti, Francesci Berni dedicated an epithalamium entitled Il Tebro in 1639 to Sarti. The poem celebrates the portrait that Sarti painted on the occasion of the wedding between Beatrice Estense Tassoni and Giovanni Francesco Sacchetti in 1631. Sarti died in 1636 and was buried in the Church of Santo Spirito in Ferrara.
